# ESP32 Digital RGB LED Drivers

A digital RGB LED (WS2812/SK6812/NeoPixel//APA102/DotStar) driver for the ESP32 

Based upon the [ESP32 WS2812 driver work by Chris Osborn](https://github.com/FozzTexx/ws2812-demo)

### Things that work currently

This currently works well with WS2812/NeoPixel LEDs - I expect SK6812 to work equally well.

There are working demos for Espressif's IoT Development Framework (esp-idf) and Espressif's Arduino-ESP32 core

### TODO

  - APA102/DotStar support
  - Better API
  - More demos
